Yesterday, I completed my TOFEL test, my first international English exam. Actually, it was easier than I thought. As a middle-aged man, sitting around with so many young people was a unique experience. Frankly, I was very nervous, which surprisingly cleared my tiredness without the need for coffee.

I wanted to assess my level of English proficiency. So I practiced in real working scenarios rather than doing many mock tests to prepare. Writing English blogs, talking with English speakers, and learning new English words from news and documentaries are all my interests and part of prepareation.

However, I suspect I may not achieve a high score due to my limited vocabulary. But I would contiously keep learning and using english.

Recently, I reached another milestone with a new project. I learned Figma from scratch and designed the first version of the project's website. Although there are AI tools that can generate entire web pages, which I have used to [build this blog](https://chriswang.ai/2023/11/18/AI-Co-Dev-Creating-Blogs-on-GitHub-Pages-with-ChatGPT-4.html). However, for this commercial project, I wanted to control the detailed layout and information for marketing purposes.

I have found that Figma is a great tool for layout design. Initially, I was stuck at the blank page, wondering where to begin. I read the offical tuorials, watched a few videos, and most importantly, started practicing with a real project.

When I finished designing the home page, including both desktop and mobile layouts, I realized I had acquired a new skill.

Every software tool I learned started from a blank slate. For example, Excel, Visual Basic, PowerPoint, SQL Server, and even ChatGPT. There are so many professionals in each segment. However, for most of us, learning by doing is sufficient. You don't need to be a professional in every skill.
Being a reliable driver is great; only the exceptionally talented become racers.

Technologies, especially AI-related ones, bring significant changes to the current environment. AI can know a lot about almost everything and even generate results in the virtual world. You should carefully consider how to apply new tools in your daily work. If you resist change, your boss may consider replacing you.

So, keep learning diligently and work smart.
