Though I am a seasoned software engineer, web front-end programming is not my forte. CSS, HTML layout, responsiveness, and browser compatibility are always challenging for me. Most of the time, I collaborate with front-end engineers.

Through my experience with many browser-related projects, I have learned the basics of web front-end development-including grammar, keywords, and some tips. However, I've never tried to build a web page on my own.

Regarding ChatGPT, I've experimented a lot with backend programming. It's a powerful tool that can significantly improve efficiency. I am curious about whether it could also aid in front-end development. Unlike backend programming, which often relies on a single language, web pages usually require three: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

So, I decided to build a new blog with ChatGPT-4 on GitHub Pages. After five hours of work, it was complete with the following features:

- One layout with three types of pages: Post List, Post, and About.
- Pagination for previous and next posts on the Post page.
- Responsive design that automatically adjusts to different screen sizes.
- Compatibility with mainstream browsers (IE, Safari, Chrome).
- Liquid syntax for rendering dynamic content.
- SEO-friendly: keywords, descriptions, and titles are easy to configure.
- Compressed CSS (courtesy of ChatGPT).
- High performance in loading and rendering.

I also tested it with Google's PageSpeed Insights, and the results were almost perfect:

During development, I didn't write any CSS, JavaScript, or HTML code, all of it was generated by prompts.

My role was to reuse the code, write some Liquid code, and run commands for testing and deployment.The prompts are not magic, they're similar to the interactions I have with colleagues.
For example:

![prompt2](/assets/resized_and_converted_image_2.jpg)

Admittedly, I'm concerned that powerful AI could replace my job, and perhaps you should be, too. But as ChatGPT itself has stated, it cannot perceive the real world, which is a significant advantage for humans.

For people like you and me, it's crucial to learn to use such tools extensively, akin to learning to drive a car. In a race, having the best car is vital, but being the best driver is key to success.
