# Operational Achievements

### [Miniso](https://www.miniso.com)

`User Operations, Community Management, and Technical Consulting`

MINISO, a large fashion retail brand, is a New York Stock Exchange-listed company. With over 3,000 stores in China, I lead a team dedicated to providing enduring customer relations, enhancing user experience, and fostering brand promotion and business growth for MINISO.

Our strategy involves integrating discounts into in-store checkout processes to attract customers into our WeChat community and convert them into members. In the community, we offer personalized service combining human touch with AI to deepen customer relationships, encourage users to share our brand on social media, and guide them back to our stores or online platform for repeated purchases.

In collaboration with MINISO's team leaders, I formulate user operation strategies, standardize workflows for team implementation, and ensure stable service quality through quantified performance tracking. Additionally, I provide IT solution recommendations and vendor suggestions for the automation of operational processes and for distribution-related business needs.

We have successfully attracted over 10 million members to our WeChat community from offline channels, providing ongoing service and automated outreach, driving over 1 billion yuan in O2O business revenue. Currently, we are expanding this user operation system to international markets.

`User Operations, Community Management, and Technical Services`

TryFun, established in 2017, is an adult pleasure DTC (Direct to Consumer) brand that leverages online e-commerce channels for direct sales. My team and I provide comprehensive services centered around user operations and experience, including software development, user operations, and customer service. By implementing a unique item code system, we achieve cost-effective user retention and aggregate user groups through social media-driven traffic, leading them into our WeChat community for long-term service. This strategy enhances customer relationships, encourages product feedback, and promotes repeat purchases.

In collaboration with the leaders of the TryFun team, we have developed and implemented an overall operational strategy and objectives, assembling technical and service teams to ensure the execution of these strategies. We conduct technical assessments and selection for the required technical input for our projects. Our approach includes performance tracking and operational reporting to ensure the achievement of our operational phase goals.

In the first year of execution, TryFun introduced groundbreaking products in the Meta series through co-creation with users, redefining adult toys and consistently ranking first in sales on mainstream e-commerce platforms. Our membership system grew from zero to over 50,000 users, driving more than 3 million in direct sales through repeat transactions. Currently, the brand is focusing on global market expansion."
