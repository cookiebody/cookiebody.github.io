# Development Portfolio

### [AlienTek Cloud](https://cloud.alientek.com)

`Golang, Redis, Postgresql, CentOS(Alibaba Cloud)`

It is a robust platform featuring a TCP server and an intuitive web management portal. Designed for streamlined device configuration and route rule setting among various devices (including ESP8266 and GPRS), the platform offers real-time device messaging via WebSocket and supports custom application development with a RESTful API.

I was responsible for the system design and backend development, collaborating with a frontend engineer on the web interface and jointly designing communication protocols with a firmware engineer.

Over 10,000 electronic engineers use this platform for building and testing IoT products, from demonstrations to fully functional prototypes.

### Specialized EMR System for Obstetrics & Gynecology

`Golang, Redis, Postgresql, CentOS(Physical Computer)`

This EMR system is uniquely designed for Obstetrics and Gynecology, with a specific focus on genitourinary system diseases. It efficiently captures structured data from diverse sources, including medical devices, physical examinations, and patient reports. The system is engineered to streamline patient follow-up processes, ensuring consistent and high-quality patient care. Additionally, it aids in the systematic collection and analysis of data, which is pivotal for clinical research and deriving insightful health trends.

I was at the forefront of designing and developing the initial version of this specialized EMR system. My role extended to [patenting its core methodology](https://patents.google.com/patent/CN107045591B/en) and leading an 8-member team through continuous iterations and successful deployments.

The system's deployment in over 80 public hospitals stands as a testament to its efficacy and reliability. It plays a crucial role as the foundational technology in a national research project, receiving endorsement from the Ministry of Science and Technology. This project's success highlights the system's significance and broad applicability in the healthcare sector.

### [WebSite Builder SaaS](https://youhaosuda.com)

`Ruby, Golang, Lua, Redis, Postgresql, MongoDB, CentOS(Tencent Cloud)`

This SaaS platform enables users to create fully-functional eCommerce websites effortlessly, without the need to manage databases or servers. It offers a range of features for managing products and content, configuring payment gateways, and using custom domains. Advanced users can further customize site themes, build landing pages, and integrate with other systems using a RESTful API, all tailored to enhance customer experience.

As the lead architect for the WebSite Builder SaaS, I played a pivotal role in shaping its core technology, designing a multi-tenant database architecture and implementing microservice layers for enhanced scalability and performance. My responsibilities extended beyond architecture to include developing key modules and several microservices. I took the lead in designing the RESTful API, boosting the platform's integrability and user experience. Additionally, I managed the infrastructure, overseeing cluster management and optimizing cost efficiency. The insights and expertise I gained from this project were shared with the broader tech community during [my presentation at RubyConfChina 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kquYahLMuZo&ab_channel=RubyChina).

The project successfully raised 10 million in funding, demonstrating market confidence and potential. It currently powers over 20,000 websites, some of which have a global operational footprint, underscoring the platform's scalability and international appeal.

### Auto Fare Collection System

`C#, MSMQ, Sybase, Windows(Physical Computer)`

This comprehensive system includes Automatic Gate Machines, Ticket Vendor Machines, and a Station Control (SC) system, among others. Utilizing a private protocol, the SC monitors and controls all ticket-related devices in real-time. It also collects transaction data to generate operational reports.

I spearheaded the development of the initial version of the AFC, with a particular focus on the SC. My work involved enhancing TCP performance to support heavy concurrent communication with up to 800 devices, ensuring stable and efficient operation. Additionally, I [patented the core method](https://patents.google.com/patent/CN103218254B/en) used in this system.

The system has been operational for over 10 years, specifically in Guangzhou Metro Line 6, serving more than one million people daily with reliability and efficiency. Its successful implementation and robust performance have led to the adoption of its codebase in various metro lines globally.
