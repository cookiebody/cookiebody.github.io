## Wang Zilong

I started my career as a programmer.

I worked with various technologies, such as C#, Ruby, Golang, PostgreSQL etc.

I am proud that a lot of code I wrote is still running.

In 2019, I started my adventure in growth operations.

I built a group operating system with CRM for a million-user group.

Besides that, I have built a standalone e-Commerce business. I operated it from 0 to million GMV.

For now, I find leveraging work is crucial. This is especially true in the AI period.

I always find new tools to use. These tools serve different purposes, such as coding and writing articles.
