## Chris Wang

Embarking on my journey in the tech industry as a developer, I have played a pivotal role in initiating and delivering a variety of innovative technological projects, including Automated Fare Collection (AFC), Software as a Service (SaaS), Electronic Medical Records (EMR), and Customer Engagement Solutions (CES).

My career trajectory has seen a dynamic evolution, advancing through key positions such as Software Architect, Technical Lead, and Business Manager.

This journey has endowed me with a diverse and rich skill set encompassing software development, team leadership, and business operations.

As a lifelong learner and proactive leader, I am eager to share my extensive experience in both technology and operations.
