## 王子龍(Chris Wang)

Beginning my journey in the tech industry as a developer, I have played a pivotal role in initiating and delivering a variety of technological projects, such as `AFC`, `SaaS`, `EMR`, and `CES` solutions.

Over time, my career path has seen a dynamic evolution, advancing through key positions like Architect, Tech Lead, and Manager.

This journey has endowed me with a rich skill set encompassing `software development`, `system design`, and `business and user operation`.

As a lifelong learner and proactive doer, I’m glad to share my experience in tech and operations.

For my work experience, you can view my [Operational Achievements](/operation) or [Development Portfolio](/development).

If you have something to discuss, feel free to [schedule a meeting](https://calenday.com/chriswang/discuss-the-topic-you-concern) and specify the topic in the appointment form.

Additionally, you can email me at `chrisloong5@gmail.com`, and I will reply as soon as possible.
